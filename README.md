# Heart Disease Prediction App ❤️

A machine learning–based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient medical attributes.  
The application provides instant predictions through an interactive Streamlit interface.

---

## Overview

Early detection of heart disease plays a critical role in preventing severe health complications.  
This project uses a trained machine learning classification model to assist in predicting the presence of heart disease based on commonly used clinical parameters.

The system is designed as a lightweight and easy-to-use web application suitable for demonstrations and educational purposes.

---

## Problem Statement

Heart disease diagnosis often requires interpreting multiple medical parameters simultaneously.  
Manual analysis can be time-consuming and prone to error, especially in early-stage detection.

This project aims to leverage machine learning to provide fast and consistent predictions based on patient data.

---

## Solution Approach

- A supervised machine learning classification model is trained on structured medical data.
- Key health features such as age, cholesterol level, heart rate, and ECG results are used.
- The trained model is saved using `joblib`.
- A Streamlit-based web interface allows users to input medical data and receive real-time predictions.
